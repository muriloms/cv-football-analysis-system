# âš½ CV Football Analysis System

Welcome to the **CV Football Analysis System**! This project leverages **AI/ML** techniques, including **YOLO**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**, to analyze football matches, track player movements, and provide insights through computer vision. The system is designed to capture and analyze real-time game data, enabling detailed performance and tactical analysis.
